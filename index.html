    <h2>Mutton varuval</h2>
    <p>Mutton sukka varuval is a simple recipe with no yoghurt or tomatoes involved. A good squeeze of lemon juice at the end will take the dish to the next level. With this dish, you need to first par-cook the meat so that it’s tender. The par-cooked mutton is then pan-fried with spices and browned onions for a taste that’s just divine!</p>
    <h4>Mutton sukka come from</h4>
    <p>It is speculated that the sukka (translated to dry) came into existence because of the dry climate. Red meat became a sustainable choice for a large population of tradesmen. Another story version goes back to the saying that skilled Saurashtrian weavers from Maharashtra brought the Mutton Sukka to the Chola kingdom.
